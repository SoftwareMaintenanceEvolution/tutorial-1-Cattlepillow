# Introduction 
Hi! I'm CHOONG YI YANG, a student in the Software Maintenance and Evolution course.  
I expect to learn a lot about modern software maintenance practices and how to work with legacy systems. 
**Fun fact**: I love playing the guitar in my free time. 
**Course expectations**: To gain hands-on experience in 
maintaining and evolving software.
